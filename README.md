# State of the Implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography

## About
Given the recent advantages in quantum computing the danger that quantum computers might be able to break currently used public key encryption (like RSA or elliptic curve cryptography) in the near future is becoming a realistic scenario. Even more since ["harvest now, decrypt later"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later) attacks, in which adversaries stores encrypted data now in order to decrypt it in the future when powerful quantum computers become available, are posing a risk right now already.

To mitigate that risk new encryption technologies have been developed under the name of "Post-Quantum Cryptography" (PQC) that are intended to protect against attacks by future quantum computers. While many organisations and security experts have advocated for a swift implementation of PQC it is unclear what the state of implementation of post-quantum cryptography currently looks like.

This website tries to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of which services, libraries, ... have implemented post-quantum cryptography already.
